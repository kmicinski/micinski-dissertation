    abstract = {{The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time series analysis is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately defined as the procedure for statistical model identification. The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.}},

abstract ={Amazon?s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is a relatively new website that contains the major elements required to conduct research: an integrated participant compensation system; a large participant pool; and a streamlined process of study design, participant recruitment, and data collection. In this article, we describe and evaluate the potential contributions of MTurk to psychology and other social sciences. Findings indicate that (a) MTurk participants are slightly more demographically diverse than are standard Internet samples and are significantly more diverse than typical American college samples; (b) participation is affected by compensation rate and task length, but participants can still be recruited rapidly and inexpensively; (c) realistic compensation rates do not affect data quality; and (d) the data obtained are at least as reliable as those obtained via traditional methods. Overall, MTurk can be used to obtain high-quality data inexpensively and rapidly.},

    title = {{EXE}: Automatically Generating Inputs of Death},
    x-abstract = {This paper presents {EXE}, an effective bug-finding tool that automatically generates inputs that crash real code. Instead of running code on manually or randomly constructed input, {EXE} runs it on symbolic input initially allowed to be "anything." As checked code runs, {EXE} tracks the constraints on each symbolic (i.e., input-derived) memory location. If a statement uses a symbolic value, {EXE} does not run it, but instead adds it as an input-constraint; all other statements run as usual. If code conditionally checks a symbolic expression, {EXE} forks execution, constraining the expression to be true on the true branch and false on the other. Because {EXE} reasons about all possible values on a path, it has much more power than a traditional runtime tool: (1) it can force execution down any feasible program path and (2) at dangerous operations (e.g., a pointer dereference), it detects if the current path constraints allow any value that causes a {bug.When} a path terminates or hits a bug, {EXE} automatically generates a test case by solving the current path constraints to find concrete values using its own co-designed constraint solver, {STP}. Because {EXE}'s constraints have no approximations, feeding this concrete input to an uninstrumented version of the checked code will cause it to follow the same path and hit the same bug (assuming deterministic {code).EXE} works well on real code, finding bugs along with inputs that trigger them in: the {BSD} and Linux packet filter implementations, the udhcpd {DHCP} server, the pcre regular expression library, and three Linux file systems.},

We used {KLEE} to thoroughly check all 89 stand-alone programs in the {GNU} {COREUTILS} utility suite, which form the core user-level environment installed on millions of Unix systems, and arguably are the single most heavily tested set of open-source programs in existence. {KLEE}-generated tests achieve high line coverage -- on average over 90\% per tool (median: over 94\%) -- and significantly beat the coverage of the developers' own hand-written test suite. When we did the same for 75 equivalent tools in the {BUSYBOX} embedded system suite, results were even better, including 100\% coverage on 31 of them. We also used {KLEE} as a bug finding tool, applying it to 452 applications (over {430K} total lines of code), where it found 56 serious bugs, including three in {COREUTILS} that had been missed for over 15 years. Finally, we used {KLEE} to crosscheck purportedly identical {BUSYBOX} and {COREUTILS} utilities, finding functional correctness errors and a myriad of inconsistencies.},
