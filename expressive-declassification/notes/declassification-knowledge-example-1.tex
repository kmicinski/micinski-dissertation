\title{Example one: revealing public contacts after button press}
\maketitle

\begin{verbatim}
\contacts.
  let bc = button<"Share contacts"> in
  bc().
    net<filter public contacts>
\end{verbatim}

What is the type of this program?  Computationally, it has this type:

\[
list(string) \to 1
\]

But it's knowledge type is much more complicated than that.  The
reason is that the knowledge type should express what information can
be learned about the input list to the program.

\begin{align}
P : \forall (x : & list(string) \text{\eye} \forall c : BC(contacts), y : con, \\
                   & \lnot (K(c \in x) U bc = ()) \land \\
                   & K(c \in x) \implies public(c)) \\ 
                   & \to 1 \text{\eye} (\forall c \in x, public(c) \implies K(c))
\end{align}

This formula says:

\begin{quote}
  If you give me a variable x (a list of strings) --- whose policy
  stipulates that it cannot be released until an appropriate release
  event occurs (which is encoded in the $BC$ type shown below) --- I
  will produce a unit value, along with giving the adversary knowledge
  about all of the public contacts in the list x.
\end{quote}

Where $BC(contacts)$ is an abbreviation for:

\begin{align}
BC(contacts) = stream(1 \text{\eye} \{x \in contacts | public(x) \})
\end{align}

The way to think of $BC$ (which is the type we ascribe to the $bc$
variable in the program, is that it is a stream which carries a
\emph{license} to release the public contacts in $contacts$.  In other
words, once the program reads a unit from the $bc$ stream, it is
allowed to release the public contacts.

Our job is to develop a calculus such that we can ascribe $bc$ this
knowledge type, and write the appropriate elim forms so that we can
ascribe the program $P$ the overall type shown above.
