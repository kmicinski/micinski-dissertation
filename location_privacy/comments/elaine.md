1. It would be interesting to see what k- we can achieve in
k-anonymity under our metric. Clearly not going to happen before

*done*

3. We should bring out more why we chose these apps as our
targets. It's in the paper, but she missed it on her read (which I
think was really fast), so maybe see if we can find a better way to
put it in. (Though, I think it's mentioned at least a couple of
times.)
