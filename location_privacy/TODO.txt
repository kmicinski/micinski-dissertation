Paper todo list
---------------

General roadmap of the paper:

- Location privacy is important

- Discuss apps and threat model

- Use Dr. Android and Mr. Hide to secure user's location.

- Explain algorithm to do this:

 - naive / traditional algorithm uses a grid to obscure locations.
 - We implemented this method in Mr. Hide
 - 

- Proof of our new skewing method.

- Utility analysis
  
  - We used troyd on a set of apps and compared our implementation of
    the algorithm to ensure the apps were not changed too much.
  -

- Experiments

  - Different metrics:
    - Edit distance, *with* taking a bounded piece of the list (only
      one or two screens)
    - How much farther do you have to go in the new version of the list.

  - Comparison across different regions based on population density.
  
  - Comparison across different apps because of properties of the apps
    (different density of gas stations, etc..)

Proposed outline:
  1. Introduction

  2. Motivation, Dr. Android and Mr. Hide:
    - List of things.
    - ...
    
  3. Formalism
  
  4. Experiments
  
  5. Related work 
  
  6. Conclusion.


Advice or learning best use:
  
  - Jeff, what do you think of this..?

  - Present algorithm based on the following: Test at points in
    - different cities using our technique Algorithm uses some
    - learning strategy (/genetic programming):
      - based on boolean combinations of context (population density of current area, app
    parameters, acceptable error to user)
      - to give implement within  Mr. Hide an automatically adjusting error metric which will
    constantly be maximizing the user's privacy.
    
  - I think this would be a powerful argument, having a static value
    you plug in for skew seems sort of dumb, adjusting skew and grid
    in combo seems better, what do you think?

  - Modeling user privacy
  - some other stuff...

Conclusion:

  - We can use Mr. Hide to secure user's location, using the
    traditional mechanisms is fine, but our new method can provably
    ensure the user is protected to some higher degree.


Firm TODOs:

- Adjust scripts to calculate statistics and generate plots for *all*
  apps.

- Implement other metrics in apps.

- Write section in paper concerning different utility metrics, based
  on lists and raw numbers (for weather, using integer difference).

- Come up with amazing new idea and proof for paper based on thereat
  model.

What Kris is working on:

- Saturday night: writing up argument for one dimensional case of user
  privacy in the initial model based upon threat model.

- Saturday night: checking whether Buzz is usable for larger sets of
  tests.

- Saturday night: Scripts need to work on the other apps too.
  (Expecting that I will find stupid things about other apps too, may
  have to do fixups.)

- Sunday morning: Modifying scripts to implement new metrics (will
  probably be pushed to Sunday morning)

- Need to make figures explaining areas analysis: using Ipe to draw PS
  based figures for paper.  (I can export to PDF so Jeff can view, the
  pstrics metadata resides within PDF comments, but I can't use
  omnigraffl on Linux, unfortunately.)
