Explanation of the different plots
==================================

For the "median" plots, we take each city, and the median error
(according to some metric) across the different locations in that city
(we chose ten).

For apps where we have lists of things, we can plot this metric as we
consider 'more and more' pieces of the list.  (For example, in our
scripts we curtail apps at a certain point.)  In GasBuddy and
Restaurant Finder, for instance, we went through the apps and found
exactly how much each screen contained (how many stations, etc..) and
then we plotted each 'turn' of the knob.

The GasBuddy results are plotted for these different values, I will
have the rest of the apps done by this on Sunday morning.
Aditionally, I need to implement some more metrics, I will talk about
exactly whic h metrics I should implement (on Saturday night) with
Jeff today (Saturday).
