Guide to the plots
------------------

For each app, we also have an associated set of plots.  We typically
run our different metrics on the apps varying a parameter (how many
things we cut off of the end of the list), usually the number of
things fitting on a single screen of the app.  For each app we vary
this between some minimum value and maximum.  For example, in GasBuddy
(and each of our other apps), we have approximately 5 things per
screen displayed.

 - medians_across_city_n.jpg - the edit distance metric evaluated for
   different values of n, where n is some multiple of the number of
   screens we've traversed.

 - medians_across_city_si_n.jpg - set intersection metric

 - medians_across_city_additional_distance.jpg - The additional
   distance metric.xs
