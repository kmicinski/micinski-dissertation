List types
----------

For apps producing lists of locations as their outputs, we process
information obtained from troyd reports and then post process the
output using a combintion of awk and shell scripts.  For each
directory which uses a list type, our ultimate goal is to produce a
large set of directories corresponding to each data point (which is a
(location,sublocation) tuple).  Each directory, corresponding to a
(location,sublocation) tuple, holds a large sequence of troyd output
files corresponding to the views on the screen forming a list.  We
need to take this data and transform it into output in a fashion such
that the output is a hashable list which we can run our analyisis
algorithms over.
