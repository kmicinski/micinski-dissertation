# An Empirical Study of Location Truncation on Android

Overall talk goals:
 - Main idea:

  We use location based services (via apps) every day, but most of
  these services are untrusted.  
  
  Why give any more information than necessary to these services?
  
  It turns out, that for many apps you can truncate location to a good
  degree without losing utility of the app.

1.  Give examples of a bunch of apps which use location based
    services: taken from our study.

2.  Discuss a few worst case scenarios when these apps leak your
    information.

3.  Ask how we can solve this:
    	- Many tools considered, 
	  - privacy and anonymity,
	  - theoretical models for protecting privacy
	  - use artificial mappings and require too much knowledge a priori
	  - (examples of all of these points)
	- Instead, use something simple: location truncation.

4.  Present study of a bunch of apps: show the different types of
    apps, how / why they used certain information, what effects
    truncation would have on these different types of apps. 
    
    Give real world examples, numbers about how many apps *can't* work
    using this technique, etc..

5.  Slide on the design of cloakdroid, provide figures illustrating
    API and then how rewriting changes the API to use CloakDroid.
    
    (Also discuss how we validated that rewriting worked, manually).

6.  Explain metrics used for evaluation:
    
    running example with app from paper (Restaurant Finder) 
    
    Edit distance
    
    Set intersection
    
    Additional distance (take a little longer to explain, perhaps
    longer example).

7.  Discuss results of study:
    
    General overview:
    	    - Additional distance probably best metric
	    - Edit distance does not have as clear a physical interpertation 
	    - Set intersection might work in some scenarios

    Specific results:
    	    - Could generally go 5 - 20 Km, without significantly (discuss) 
	    affecting utility	    

8.  Condensed results from each metric.
    
    - A little time on edit distance, when might it be good?

    - A little more time on set intersection, when and why might it be
      good?

    - Longer time on additional distance, examples given to support
      hypothesis that denser region implies more truncation ability.

9.  Questions / answers?

Additional slides:

    - Pictorial illustration of why you "lose more stuff" at the edges
      of a circle.

    - More graphs..?
